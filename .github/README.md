Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on [Linux container](https://linuxcontainers.org/) technology written in [Golang](https://golang.org/).

Vela uses a syntax similar to [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to define its configuration. This structure for repeated use, within the application, is called a pipeline and a single execution of a pipeline is referenced as a build.
